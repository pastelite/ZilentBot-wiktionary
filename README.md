## ZilentBot
File for ZilentBot. It's created in 2018 when I'm still noobie, so don't expect code to be that good. For script in pywikibot folder you need [pywikibot](https://github.com/wikimedia/pywikibot)
## Explanation of each script
* **finnish-decl**: created declension page of Finnish lemmas
* **lexitron-import**: created english page with translation. the information comefrom lexitron
* **ficreate**: the same thing as finnish-decl, but using pywikibot and much shorter
* **hucreate**: the same thing as ficreate, but in Hungarian
* **multidict**: originally wanted to create my own dictionry wiki using data from [here](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/). as you can guess, failed. but it may be useful in help improving wiktionary. i don't know.
## Credit
* Json file used in lexitronimport.js can be found [here](https://github.com/pureexe/node-thaidict). I don't even know about node module or optimisation at the time, so It's pretty slow
